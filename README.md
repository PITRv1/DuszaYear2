General stuff for the team:
- Naming convention:
So just to keep things organised during development I thought it would be good to have a naming convension to keep scripts and assets consistent throughout the project

1. Use snake_case for => variable names, function names, file names (such as scenes and scripts and resources)
2. Use camelCase for => signal names
3. Use PascalCase for => class, singeltons
